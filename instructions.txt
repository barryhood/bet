Initial View
Load and parse the data in snapshot.csv into a model.

Render a grid based on that data to the DOM.

Updates
Write an engine to work through deltas.csv and emit update messages to parse.

When only a number exists on a line, that amount of time in milliseconds should 
be waited until processing the next set of deltas. When the last set of deltas 
is processed, return to the start of the file and repeat.

Each set of deltas should be merged into the existing dataset and then 
propagated to the DOM in the most efficient manner possible.

Provide notification that an item has been updated via a visual flare in the UI.

Bonus Task
Render a chart in canvas based on the tick data to show the changes over time. 
It should update on each tick.
